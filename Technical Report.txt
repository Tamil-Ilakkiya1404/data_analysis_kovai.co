Technical Report On Using Random Forest Regressor for the given dataset

Random Forest Regressor:
	It is an ensemble technique which incorporates constructing multiple decision trees during training and merges their results to produce an 
efficient solution. It is a powerful model for forecasting and regression tasks.
	
Working of the algorithm:
	A decision tree splits the data into subsets based on the feature and As the name itself suggests, Random Forest builds decision trees 
on a random subsets of data and features.

Models Parameters:
	n_estimators - Number of trees in the forest
	max_depth - Maximum depth of each tree in the forest
	random_state - Ensures reproducibility.

ARIMA MODEL - For Forecasting
	It is abbreviated as Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average.It is a statistical method for time series forecasting. It is used 
to predict the future values based on the past data. 
Itâ€™s model parameters are p,q and d. Where p - Autoregressive order, 
d - differencing order and q - Moving Average Order.
	Using ARIMA model, I have forecasted the number of journeys by local Route, Light Rail, peak Service, Rapid Route and School for 
the next 7 days.
